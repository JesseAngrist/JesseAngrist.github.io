# Welcome to My Blog

This is a placeholder post to demonstrate the blog system.

## What to Expect

I'll be writing about:

- Energy systems, engineering, and sustainability
- Problems I'm thinking about
- My personal experiences and worldview. I believe in [writing as metamorphic activity!](https://www.personalcanon.com/i/180695319/writing-as-metamorphic-activity)
