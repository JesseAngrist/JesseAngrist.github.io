                <h1>Solar Microgrids for Human Health, Environmental Benefit, and Rural Electricity Access in Developing Countries</h1>
                <p>For my final project of SPI306: Environmental Economics (Fall 2025), taught by Smita Brunnermeier, I researched and gave a presentation
                    on Bangladesh's Solar Home Systems policy, which was funded by the World Bank for nearly two decades. The two principal goals
                    of the presentation were to analyze an environmental policy using the criteria we had learned in class and to discuss the 
                    research methods employed by the economic studies we cite. The former is much more present in the presentation below, and the latter
                    I discussed aloud during my presentation, which wasn't recorded. Personally, this research really heartened me; development
                    economics is littered with cases of bad policies badly implemented, which have saddled hundreds of millions with additional years of poverty.
                    At least during the "golden years" of the SHS policy before some 2015 reforms, it seems to have had an excellent record of cost-effectively
                    raising the standard of living for millions of people in rural Bangladesh. Today 99%+ have access to grid electricity! That's really exciting!<br><br> </p>
