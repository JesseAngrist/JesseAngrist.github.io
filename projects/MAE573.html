                <h1>Long-Distance Transmission and System Impacts</h1>
                <p>After learning about the regulation of the electricity sector, I really wanted to apply quantitative skills to solve problems
                    in energy systems. So, in the Fall of my sophomore year, I took MAE573/ENE573: Applied Optimization for Energy Systems Engineering, taught by Professor Jesse Jenkins.
                    For my final project, I analyzed the system impacts of a hypothetical transmission line between the Midwest (Northern MISO) and the Pacific Northwest
                    (approximately the Bonneville Power Administration) using the open-source capacity expansion model GenX (developed also by Prof. Jenkins and his lab) with data inputs
                    for the United States generated by the PowerGenome project.

                    <br><br>In retrospect, I kind of wish I had chosen a different research question, since I think few decisionmakers fundamentally doubt that long-distance transmission is cost-effective on balance, 
                    and none of the results were terribly shocking, except for the distributional implications. (Even though energy ends up being traded roughly evenly on the line, the cost savings
                    mostly accrue to the Pacific Northwest). But I learned a ton about energy systems modelling, using open-source tools, and performance computing. I went through
                    a lot of stress configuring my casework - several times only to find out I had made a silly mistake *after* waiting hours for the models to run - because I was running up against the limits
                    of PowerGenome (which is still a well-documented tool!). The sheer number of niche obstacles I encountered which I (irrationally) wished had been documented for me has totally changed how I approach
                    developing tools for others. I also underwent some normal growing pains getting acquainted with Princeton's <a href="https://researchcomputing.princeton.edu/systems/adroit">Adroit cluster</a> and managing
                    local and remote workflows mediated by ssh. All in all, it was still a tremendous learning experience, and it made me feel much better equipped to indepedently formulate and answer questions in the electricity sector!<br><br>
