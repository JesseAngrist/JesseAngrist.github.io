                <h1>Regulatory and Decarbonization Study of German Electricity System</h1>
                <p>In the Spring of my freshman year, I took Professor Jesse Jenkins' course MAE422/ENE422: Introduction to the Electricity Sector: Engineering, Economics, and Regulation. 
                    For my final project, I conducted a regulatory and decarbonization study of the German electricity system, focusing on the industrial state of North Rhine-Westphalia (NRW).
                    To carry out this study, I had to read a lot of arcane legal documents in the original German! Think of it as learning about the US electricity sector 
                    by reading the text of the 1935 Federal Power Act. My report includes three recommendations for regulatory improvements to meet demand growth and decarbonize simultaneously,
                    such as creating regional wholesale price signals, reforming distribution company compensation formulas to responsibly meet demand growth, and to clear legal barriers to
                    demand-side resources and aggregators, who are otherwise advantaged by Germany's competitive retail market structure, which already allows customers to choose
                    to be exposed to fluctuating wholesale prices. You can read the full report below!<br><br>
